This is a clean, scala-based, rewrite of the AQuery system.

This is a temporary repo, and eventually all contents here will be merged
with the original AQuery repo.


edu.nyu.aquery.ast contains all representations for AST
edu.nyu.aquery.parse contains all parsing code

TODO:
1 - tests for ast/parsing
2 - analyzer (serial)
   - order-dependence
   - grouped
3 - Optimizer (serial)
4 - Code gen (serial)

5 - Analyzer (parallel)
6 - Optimizer (parallel)
7- Code gen (parallel)
